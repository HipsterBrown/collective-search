36,Softcraft - Open Apprenticeship,Learn software development collaboratively.,MXN,TRUE,"## Objective   Teach how to develop software by doing and creating a group of people willing to learn with mentors willing to share their knowledge.  ## Justification  Software development is a craft that takes a lot of practice and dedication to excel. But we think that through mentorship and learning from other we can help to reduce the learning curve and improve our abilities collectively.  We all have learned from others and our knowledge is the result of the interactions we've made over our career.  If you are an experienced software developer you will have the opportunity to pay it forward and learn by sharing or if you are a beginner and are willing to go do what it takes, you'll find the help you need to find a way to complete your goals.  ## Social software  We believe great software comes from great teams, and great teams are formed by people that work together and trust each other. We seek with this initiative to generate relationships that will help in the creation of a community of professionals that can move our profession forward.  ## How it works  With the help of mentors apprentices will:  1. Define a learning goal (measurable and with a date to be completed) 2. Work on projects, read, explore and perform exercises that will help them on their goal. 3. Interact with other apprentices to share what they are learning 4. Receive feedback and guidance from mentors.  Each apprentice is responsible of it's own growth and learning, but they will have the support of a network of peers and experienced developers.  ## Donations  * An apprentice needs to give a donation to participate in the program, the amount of the donation is open. * Mentors commits to give an specific amount of time each week and will provide it free of charge. * Everyone can make donation to support us.",https://cldup.com/rYzgSfEZCZ.png,softcraft,http://softcraft.mx,solojavier,We are on a mission to teach software development collaboratively.,,,FALSE,COLLECTIVE,"{""githubContributors"":{""solojavier"":239,""enrique-ramirez"":146,""tavorazo"":7,""mvidaurre"":2,""undefined"":null,""joseluistorres"":1},""repos"":{""Kairos"":{""stars"":1},""inspira.ac"":{""stars"":1},""bike-store"":{""stars"":0},""jovenes.inspira.ac"":{""stars"":0},""elixir-env"":{""stars"":0},""community-manager"":{""stars"":0},""libro"":{""stars"":0},""inspiratuvida.org"":{""stars"":0},""ws"":{""stars"":0},""mobprogramming"":{""stars"":0},""inspiravida.org"":{""stars"":0},""inspiramx.org"":{""stars"":0},""rubygdl"":{""stars"":0},""rank_results"":{""stars"":0},""rubygdl.org"":{""stars"":2},""mind-sweeper"":{""stars"":0}}}",2017-10-05 19:31:22.047+00,2017-11-23 19:31:32.355+00,

Given that privacy is a fundamental human right enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, this is simply how the world should be.  That's why we're building CrypTag, which aims to enable exactly this on desktop and on mobile... and that's just the beginning (see below).  A command line-based version of CrypTag was unveiled at DEF CON, ""the world's largest underground hacker conference"", in August of 2015.  Since then we've been hard at work refining the technology to let you store your data anywhere (e.g., in Dropbox or Sandstorm), and to access your data from mobile (beginning with Ubuntu Phone).  We're now getting started on creating the sharing functionality as well as a desktop app for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.  For this technology to be trustworthy, it must be open source.  And for the most vulnerable people in our society who need privacy the most to afford it -- activists, journalists, whistle-blowers, and so on -- it must be free.  First and foremost, we need your support to create an easy-to-use desktop app for all!  But we're not stopping there.  CrypTag's underlying technology, which both encrypts your data and makes it searchable by tags you create or that are automatically added (e.g., you tag your pictures of Paris with ""paris"", and CrypTag automatically adds the tag ""picture"" to all your photos, so you can later search for ""photos of Paris""), makes it possible to make software that is privacy-respecting that normally couldn't be, like group password managers, task management apps, and more.

41,Techfugees,A tech community response to the European refugee crisis.,GBP,TRUE,"Moved by the plight of refugees in Europe, a number of technology industry people led by Mike Butcher, the Editor-at-large of TechCrunch.com, formed a voluntary team to create the series of non-profit ÛÏTechfugeesÛ conferences, hackathons, and work with a global network of collaborators. In its first 48 hours after it was started on September 13, 2015, the Techfugees Facebook Group and Twitter account exploded. Since then, Techfugees has grown over 3,500 members of Techfugees worldwide, with local chapters in key cities around the world (e.g. London, New York, San Francisco, Sydney, Melbourne, Paris, Warsaw, Amsterdam) and with partner events happening each month online and offline demonstrating a huge desire amongst the tech community to get involved with this issue. Our events are entirely non-profit, designed to bring together tech engineers, entrepreneurs and startups together with NGOs and other agencies in order to address the crisis in ways where the technology world can bring its considerable firepower. Today, Techfugees is a coordinator and curator a technology community response. Techfugees itself as a network does not designs the products and projects, but the community it brings together.

100,DiEM25,,EUR,TRUE,"A MANIFESTO FOR DEMOCRATISING EUROPE For all their concerns with global competitiveness, migration and terrorism, only one prospect truly terrifies the Powers of Europe: Democracy!   They speak in democracyÛªs name but only to deny, exorcise and suppress it in practice.  They seek to co-opt, evade, corrupt, mystify, usurp and manipulate democracy in order to break its energy and arrest its possibilities. For rule by EuropeÛªs peoples, government by the demos, is their nightmare.  The European Union could have been the proverbial Beacon on the Hill, showing the world how peace and solidarity may be snatched from the jaws of centuries-long conflict and bigotry.   Alas, today, a common bureaucracy and a common currency divide European peoples that were beginning to unite despite our different languages and cultures. Now, today, Europeans are feeling let down by EU institutions everywhere.From Helsinki to Lisbon, from Dublin to Crete, from Leipzig to Aberdeen. A stark choice is approaching fast. The choice between authentic democracy and insidious disintegration.   At the heart of our disintegrating EU there lies a guilty deceit: A highly political, top-down, opaque decision-making process is presented as Û÷apoliticalÛª, Û÷technicalÛª, Û÷proceduralÛª and Û÷neutralÛª. Its purpose is to prevent Europeans from exercising democratic control over their money, communities, working conditions and environment.   The price of this deceit is not merely the end of democracy but also the dream of shared prosperity: The Eurozone economies are being marched off the cliff of competitive austerity, resulting in permanent recession in the weaker countries and low investment in the core countries EU member-states outside the Eurozone are alienated, seeking inspiration and partners in suspect quarters Unprecedented inequality, declining hope and misanthropy flourish throughout Europe The more they asphyxiate democracy, the less legitimate their political authority becomes, the stronger the forces of economic recession, and the greater their need for further authoritarianism.   Thus democracyÛªs enemies gather renewed power while losing legitimacy and confining hope and prosperity to the very few (who may only enjoy it behind the gates and the fences needed to shield them from the rest of society). This is the unseen process by which EuropeÛªs crisis is turning our peoples inwards, against each other, amplifying pre-existing jingoism, xenophobia.  The privatisation of anxiety, the fear of the Û÷otherÛª, the nationalisation of ambition, and the re-nationalisation of policy threaten a toxic disintegration of common interests from which Europe can only suffer. EuropeÛªs pitiful reaction to its banking and debt crises, to the refugee crisis, to the need for a coherent foreign, migration and anti-terrorism policy, are all examples of what happens when solidarity loses its meaning.   Two dreadful options dominate: Retreat into the cocoon of our nation-states Or surrender to the Brussels democracy-free zone There must be another course. And there is! It is the one official Û÷EuropeÛª resists with every sinew of its authoritarian mind-set: A surge of democracy! Edmund BurkeÛªs line applies to todayÛªs Europe perfectly: ÛÏThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good people do nothing.Û   Committed democrats must resolve to act across Europe.   With a view to call forth just such a surge, we are gathering on 9th February in Berlin to found a movement,DiEM25. We come from every part of Europe and are united by different cultures, languages, accents, political party affiliations, ideologies, skin colours, gender identities, faiths and conceptions of the good society.   We come together as committed Europeans determined to prevent a clueless EU establishment, which is deeply contemptuous of democracy, from rendering impossible an authentically democratic European union.   One simple, radical idea is the motivating force behind DiEM25: Democratise Europe! The EU will either be democratised or it will disintegrate!   Our immediate priority is   (A) full transparency in decision-making (e.g. live-streaming of European Council, Ecofin and Eurogroup meetings, full disclosure of trade negotiation documents, publication of ECB minutes etc.) and   (B) the urgent redeployment of existing EU institutions in the pursuit of innovative policies that genuinely address the crises of debt, banking, inadequate investment, rising poverty and migration.   Our medium-term goal, once EuropeÛªs various crises have been stabilised, is to convene a constitutional assembly where Europeans will deliberate on how to bring forth, by 2025, a full-fledged European democracy, featuring a sovereign Parliament that respects national self-determination and sharing power with national Parliaments, regional assemblies and municipal councils.   We call on our fellow Europeans to join us forthwith to create DiEM25 and to fight together to democratise the European Union, to end the reduction of all political relations into relations of power masquerading as merely technical decisions; to subject the EUÛªs bureaucracy to the will of sovereign European peoples; to dismantle the habitual domination of corporate power over the will of citizens; and to re-politicise the rules that govern our single market and common currency. We are inspired by a Europe of Reason, Liberty, Tolerance and Imagination made possible by comprehensive Transparency, real Solidarity and authentic Democracy.   We aspire to: A Democratic Europe in which all political authority stems from EuropeÛªs sovereign peoples   A Transparent Europe where all decision-making takes place under the citizensÛª scrutiny   A United Europe whose citizens have as much in common across countries as within them   A Realistic Europe that sets itself the task of radical, yet achievable, democratic reforms   A Decentralised Europe that uses central power to maximise democracy locally   A Pluralist Europe of regions, ethnicities, faiths, nations, languages and cultures   An Egalitarian Europe that celebrates difference and ends all forms of discrimination   A Cultured Europe that harnesses its peoplesÛª cultural diversity   A Social Europe that recognises freedom from exploitation as a prerequisite for true liberty   A Productive Europe that directs investment into a shared, green prosperity   A Sustainable Europe that lives within the planetÛªs means An Ecological Europe engaged in genuine world-wide green transition   A Creative Europe that releases the innovative powers of its citizensÛª imagination   A Technological Europe pressing new technologies in the service of solidarity   A Historically-minded Europe that seeks a bright future without hiding from its past An Internationalist Europe that treats non-Europeans as ends-in-themselves   A Peaceful Europe de-escalating tensions in its neighbourhood and beyond   An Open Europe that is alive to ideas, people and inspiration from all over the world, recognising fences and borders as signs of weakness and sources of insecurity   A Liberated Europe where privilege, prejudice, deprivation and the threat of violence wither, allowing Europeans to be born into fewer stereotypical roles, to enjoy even chances to develop their potential, and to be free to choose more of their partners in life, work and society.

And we really mean an adapted project with dev tools and test environment for the framework you chose.  ### Module and dependency management This is certainly the second most structuring choice you have to do when you start a Webapp these days. Webpack, SystemJS, any of them? And believe us, this choice pulls a lot of tooling and configurations to make. FountainJS provides this simple choice and configure your project following it.  ### JavaScript version It's became rare to start a webapp in pure browser compatible JavaScript. Everyone is about Babel or TypeScript but this needs tooling.  ### Style (CSS) meta-language The oldest preprocessors area. You just have to choose Stylus, Sass or Less (or nothing).  *** And we focus on three objectives:  ### Developer eXperience The proposed tooling is focused on offering the best developer experience. The extremly dynamic ecosystem of the modern Web development has to be an asset instead of creating fatigue.  Whatever the options you choose, you'll get a development server embedded, live reload enabled, even hot module reload when possible.  Of course, for delivering, you still have the optimization task to produce a state of the art optimized dist version.  ### Ready to go The main point of FountainJS is to deliver a stable project whatever the very different options you could choose and always keep up to date with latest versions of every frameworks and tools.  ### Composition From the user point of view, FountainJS is a very complete generator.

This is the open collective of iDoneThis. We are a company based in San Francisco.  We believe that software can empower employees to build the company that they want to work and live in. [iDoneThis](http://idonethis.com) makes it easy to track and celebrate the progress that you make at work every day. We email you at day's end and ask, ""What'd you get done today?"" Just reply. The next morning, you'll get a digest that shows you the team's accomplishments from yesterday. Start a conversation and share your thanks.  Our approach is to build software that you don't have to remember to use. We're focused on keeping it simple and lightweight, because software should amplify what you get done, not get in the way. We make design decisions based on customer feedback & data, social science, and our gut.  iDoneThis was part of [AngelPad #3](http://angelpad.org) in 2011.  We couldn't build iDoneThis without Open Source. Here is a list of Open Source Software that we use and love. We created this open collective to support the open source community so that more startups like us will be able to exist and create amazing tools.  We are committing $500/month. This money will be distributed to the [open source collectives](https://opencollective.com/opensource) with a priority to the projects that we particularly love and use (see the list below).  ## Projects that are some of our favorites:  -

193,FreeRideToVote,Pooling money to give people who need it a free ride to go out and vote in November _Ù_¥Ïü_ÙÑ_ÏÒÏÎü,USD,TRUE,"# Update November 12th 2016  Thank you for supporting #FreeRideToVote, our collective effort to give people free rides to go vote on November 8th.  ## TL;DR; - We collectively raised $2k (~150 free rides) - We collectively spent $0 (No one requested to have their ride reimbursed) - If you want to be refunded, just send an email to info@freeridetovote.opencollective.com. Otherwise, your donation will go to the host of the collective (http://Engine.is, the voice of startups in government). They will be able to use those funds for future open collectives aligned with their mission.  We ended up raising a little over $2,000 which was enough money to provide 150 free rides.  Unfortunately, our efforts to find people interested in the rides were unsuccessful. We reached out to local newspapers, people living in swing states, and grassroots organizations without much luck.  **Many factors could explain this:** - People naturally offered free rides on their own initiative (awesome!) https://twitter.com/search?q=%22free%20ride%20to%20vote%22&src=typd  - Even some taxi drivers did https://twitter.com/Sedbrock/status/795962780008534016  - Uber, Lyft, ZipCar offered free/discounted rides in a couple of states http://lifehacker.com/uber-lyft-and-zipcar-are-giving-free-or-discounted-ri-1788693882 - There were many other larger initiatives including this one that raised $475k https://www.crowdpac.com/campaigns/100604/the-best-way-you-can-help-hillary-now-fund-rides-to-the-polls -- given that amount raised, they were able to get a promo code from Lyft and Uber which highly simplified the process.  ## What next?  We partnered with Engine.is who became the host for this FreeRideToVote collective, meaning that they were collecting the donations on our behalf. Engine is a non profit that aims to be the voice of startups in government. Engine was instrumental in helping to defeat SOPA/PIPA and securing passage of the JOBS Act.  Since we didnÛªt end up using one penny of the funds raised, we could refund your donation in full. Just reply to this email if thatÛªs what youÛªd like. Otherwise, your money will remain with the host of the collective (Engine.is) who will be able to use that money for future open collectives that will be aligned with their mission. You will still be able to track how your money will be spent.  Thank you for being part of this effort, we are sorry that we couldnÛªt make this more impactful this time. We'll do a better job in two years time!  - Xavier, Pia and Aseem on behalf of the #FreeRideToVote collective  ---  # #FreeRideToVote   A democracy functions best when every citizen feels empowered to vote, without regard to economic status. Any barriers to voting - like inability to get to the polling station - take away from a functioning, efficient democracy. Why don't we pool money to give people a free ride to go out and vote in November?  # Get your ride to vote reimbursed!  It shouldn't cost you anything to go vote. If you have a receipt for your Uber, Lyft or Taxi ride to vote today, [submit it here](https://opencollective.com/FreeRideToVote/expenses/new) and you'll get reimbursed.  # Who are we?  This is everyone's collective. It's open to anyone who wants to contribute. And like open source projects, the people directing it can change over time depending on who is contributing the most.  At the moment, this collective is being started by Aseem, Pia and Xavier, the cofounders of OpenCollective.com  # Contribute  The best way to contribute, beside donating to this collective, is to offer a ride yourself to the people in your community. Use the hashtag #FreeRideToVote on Election Day!  We also need people to join this collective. If you have spare time and if you feel like you could contribute something to this movement, please reach out: freeridetovote@opencollective.com.  We are particularly interested in people with experience working in poor and underserved neighborhoods in those swing states.  If you work at Uber, Lyft or any other transportation company, we would love to work with you. Maybe we can facilitate the process to have a larger impact together.  We could also use an improved logo if you are a designer and this inspires you :-)  # FAQ   ## How we will use the money?  If you live in a Swing State (Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Wisconsin), you can submit the receipt for your ride on this page. We will review it and reimburse you on your paypal account.   ## Limitations  We will reimburse, public transport fares to a polling station and Uber Pool and Lyft Line rides with receipts, that have been performed on election day (November 8th 2016). You need to submit the email receipt. We will verify that the destination is a polling station. We will anonymize the data before making it public (and blur where youÛªve been picked up). We'll cap it at a maximum of $15 per ride.   **Please note we will only pay for rides whitin the limits of the funds available**  ## Transparency  How do I know that the money will be used in the best possible way? You will be able to follow on this page how the money is used, that's the principle of an open collective. The only way we can get the money out of this fund is by submitting expenses (in this case mostly Uber/Lyft email receipts, but we may also decide to rent shuttles for example)  **Let's do this.**  LetÛªs not watch all this happen in front of our eyes without doing anything. We can do great things together.

We have created a space that promotes and protects children's rights through providing nutritious food and creative educational activity.

We provide healthy meals combined with education around food and healthy hygiene habits. Û¢	Education ÛÒ Education drives sustainable social change within communities. More often than not, we use the arts as the preferred medium. Interaction and enjoyment are the keys to unlocking childrenÛªs learning. We provide drama, art, music, yoga, healthy cooking, physical education, sustainable gardening, and recreation classes.   Û¢	Social inclusion - We work with children from many difficult backgrounds and circumstances. The children learn to respect themselves and support each other within this community context. We work closely with the families as to provide a holistic approach to the childÛªs integral development.   Û¢ Environment and Sustainability ÛÒ Teaching children about ecology, gardening, sustainability, and recycling, provides them with the tools to live more sustainable and healthy lives. We teach children to nurture and respect their local environment, which in return has a positive impact on their personal health. Our goal is to expand our repertoire of education workshops. We plan to offer activities in cooking (parents and children), sexual education (for the older children), dance, circus, sports, martial arts, and carpentry (specifically - instrument making).

Our goal is to turn Brussels into a platform for citizen-driven innovation.  Our organisation offers you digital tools, as well as administrative advice to simplify and legalise your open-source activity.  We  enable  communities to create a virtual entity so that they can start collecting money and launch events without having to worry about setting up yet another legal entity.  Our community operates in full transparency as we believe in open-source and digital innovation.  # FAQ  **What can an open collective do?**  An open collective can collect one time and recurring donations (monthly or yearly). Anyone in the community can file expenses for reimbursement. After approval by the administrators of the collective, the host (in this case #BrusselsTogether ASBL) reimburses the full amount. You can also create events and sell tickets and sponsorships.  Check out these examples:  [VeganizerBXL](https://opencollective.com/veganizerbxl)  [Civic Innovation Network](https://opencollective.com/civicinnovationnetwork)  **How much does it cost?**  * There is a 10% administration fee + credit card fees (1.4% + âÂ0.25 for European cards and 2.9% + âÂ0.25 for non-European cards).  **What are the limitations?**  You cannot hire people (except freelancers or via [SMartbe](http://smartbe.be/en/)). Beyond that, your collective acts as your own virtual association.  **How to apply?**  It only takes a few minutes to have your collective up & running!   [Launch your collective](https://opencollective.com/brusselstogether/apply)  **Why do we do what we do?**  There are many people who are trying to bring Brussels to the 21st century. People who are trying to redefine mobility, education, environment, art, culture, etc.   Community building is crucial to answer these challenges.  Today, communities rely on competitive processes to get funding through subsidies. It's a distraction and it's not sustainable. There's got to be a better way.  That's what we want to explore with #BrusselsTogether. Can we recreate a city from the bottom up, with transparency, inclusiveness, and an experimentation spirit as its core?

245,Analyze Basilicata,"La prima campagna, trasparente e dal basso, nata per dare una risposta concreta alle criticitÌÊ ambientali lucane.",EUR,TRUE,"### PerchÌ©?  In pochi anni, l'Italia ed il mondo hanno imparato a conoscere gli angoli piÌ_ suggestivi della Basilicata: i sassi di Matera, il castello di Melfi, le spiagge di Maratea, la ricca Venosa e gli splendidi borghi che tempestano il territorio della Regione da nord a sud sono diventati meta di folte schiere di turisti che iniziano ad apprezzare e ad amare la Lucania.  Come dargli torto, vista da fuori puÌ_ sembrare un paradiso. E un paradiso, di sicuro, lo era.  Al turista che si arrampica accaldato per i Sassi, i problemi di questa terra malata arrivano come un'eco difficile da decifrare ed intendere. Esiste, perÌ_, un altro elenco di localitÌÊ meno belle, ma altrettanto importanti.  ITREC, Fenice, Tecnoparco, il COVA, Tempa Rossa, la Centrale del Mercure ed i SIN della Val Basento e di Tito. Nomi che non possono dire molto a chi vive la Regione pochi giorni l'anno. Quel che piÌ_ stupisce, perÌ_, Ì¬ che una simile sorditÌÊ colpisca anche molti degli abitanti della Lucania.  La Basilicata, come tutte le cose belle, Ì¬ una terra molto fragile.  Una fragilitÌÊ che, oggi, Ì¬ sotto gli occhi di tutti, grazie all'operato instancabile delle ecomafie di bassa ed alta estrazione sociale, che hanno utilizzato un territorio scarsamente abitato per tombare tonnellate di rifiuti; grazie allo stoccaggio di rifiuti ad alta radioattivitÌÊ; alle incessanti estrazioni petrolifere, alle connesse attivitÌÊ di trattamento e reiniezione; allo scarso monitoraggio ambientale e ad un controllo scadente, quando non assente. Soprattutto, perÌ_, grazie al silenzio e all'indifferenza dei suoi abitanti.  ""Analyze Basilicata"" nasce per sensibilizzare gli italiani e, prima, i lucani sulle pressanti emergenze ambientali che colpiscono la Regione: guardiamo in faccia la realtÌÊ, fermiamo la narrazione del paese in cui tutto funziona. Non per il gusto di essere negativi o disfattisti, ma per aprire gli occhi ed insieme invertire la rotta.  Quando ognuno avrÌÊ rubato quel che puÌ_, che almeno ci abbia lasciato una coscienza piÌ_ forte e la voglia di difendere questa terra incantata.  ### Cosa facciamo  ÛÏAnalizziamo la BasilicataÛ nasce nellÛªestate del 2015 come iniziativa dellÛªassociazione COVA Contro, volta alla raccolta di fondi necessari a dare una risposta concreta e scientifica alle criticitÌÊ ambientali lucane. In pochi mesi, la Campagna ha raccolto centinaia di sottoscrizioni tramite la sua pagina Facebook.  Con quei fondi - svariate migliaia di euro - Ì¬ stata acquistata la necessaria strumentazione, sono stati eseguiti campionamenti in situ in molteplici punti della Regione ed analisi chimiche presso laboratori accreditati da Accredia (lÛªente unico italiano di accreditamento scientifico).  Su quegli esami si basano anche alcuni dei pezzi dÛªinchiesta pubblicati sul quotidiano online Basilicata24.it e, successivamente, sul blog Punto eBasta.  La fiducia dei donatori Ì¬, naturalmente, un valore essenziale. Ìö per questo che Analizziamo la Basilicata Ì¬ nata come unÛªiniziativa trasparente, con una costante rendicontazione di introiti e spese sostenute e di cui Open Collective rappresenta l'ultima evoluzione.  Allo stesso modo, i dati raccolti ed ogni altra informazione relativi alla Campagna sono pubblici, cosÌÂ come lo sono i volti di coloro che a questa campagna lavorano e quelli di coloro i quali lÛªhanno finanziata.",http://analizebasilicata.altervista.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cropped-Plants-Trees-Deciduous-tree.png,analyzebasilicata,http://analizebasilicata.altervista.org/,PuntoebastaBas,Siamo in missione per contribuire a tutelare l'ambiente e la salute in Lucania.,,,FALSE,COLLECTIVE,{},2016-09-12 17:54:32.181+00,2017-10-17 06:32:27.447+00,

Webpack bundles both ES6, CommonJS, and AMD modules (even combined). In addition to code-splitting, webpack can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time). Dependencies are resolved during compilation reducing the runtime size.  Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. coffeescript to JavaScript, handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc. webpack makes no assumption about your workflow, framework of choice, or development environment, and because of that, we are in the top 1% most used packages on npm!!!

336,Womer,Womer is a word-of-mouth booster for responsible local shops.,EUR,TRUE,"For obvious reasons, we gradually become aware of the limitations of the current economic system: as it created (much) wealth, it generates inequalities, exclusion, ill-being, global warming and increasing scarcity of natural resources ...     Facing this situation, small businesses of all forms (delicatessens, food cooperatives, ecological clothing stores, ...) are appearing on our territories and selling high quality products/services, whether in a sustainable way or simply in the human authenticity of their relationship with the customer.     But let's face the truth, it's not always easy for them. Because of lack of time and money or of isolation and unaccessibility, they don't meet the success they should. And yet, a lot of polls show that a majority of people would want to change their consumption habits towards these kind of products. Something must be missing...  So... let's fix it. Together, let's make them become mainstream.   # Mission  We are on a mission to make responsible shops more visible, accessible and resilient.   **Our VISION:** We want to give the possibility for everyone to drive change towards a more sustainable world.  # Values  ## Sustainability  We want to make our cities more eco-friendly and sustainable. All decisions will be made with the overarching goal to drive change in this direction.  **Our commitment**: We make a selection of the small businesses committed to our [quality charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rYAx--qnQ40r0BCl64G-TFbPaqO2asM_CXjyvmrlQeQ/edit?usp=sharing).  ## Collective  We want to improve the basic customer/merchant relationship and go beyond the purely buyer/seller scheme. We believe customers and merchants sharing the same values should get together to build a better social collectivity in their city.   **Our commitment**: We organize events to bring these two separated groups sharing the same values together.  ## Creativity  We believe creativity is the core energy of a collective. This is his very first added value. It also maintains positiveness and harmony.  **Our commitment**: We will always prefer a bottom-up approach and include the collective in the important decisions. That's why our collective is using [**Slack**](https://slack.com/) and [**Loomio**](https://www.loomio.org/) to self-organize and empower his members.  ## Independence  We donÛªt want to depend on any public or private institutions. We want to always remain serving 100% the interests of the collective members. This found the resilience of our business model.  **Our commitment**: We will remain funded mainly by the collective. To become a member, [**back us**](https://opencollective.com/womer#support) :-)  ## Transparency  We love transparency as a guarantee for trust and the minimum condition to create inspiring organisations in the 21st century.  **Our commitment**: We will serve as an example of **self-organized** and **self-sustained** organisation, with this open-collective you can track every single expense that we have made with our backersÛª donations.  #FAQ  ## Why?  Ecological awareness is growing in Belgium and in Europe, that's a fact. But somehow, something is missing for many people to do their part towards the right direction. In the urgency of the day-to-day life:     - Small independant businesses lack visibility to continue or expand their business against the big brands. - As for us, humans, citizens of the world, of a nation or a city, despite our desire to consume differently, too often we lack information, time or money to actually change our consumption habits that are feeding a system which we don't trust anymore.     Finally, despite their difficulties, we believe that both these more or less isolated players want to basically go in the same direction ... To act locally for a more human, genuine solidarity !  #### We want to fill this gap by providing a tool for these shops and consumers sharing the same values to unite and act together to do their part.  ## What?  We bring them together to be more resilient, as a collective with common values and we use the power of technology to boost their reach.   In this effort we do two main things:  - We organize events (meetups, workshops, afterworks,...). By doing this we want to co-create a [Quality Charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rYAx--qnQ40r0BCl64G-TFbPaqO2asM_CXjyvmrlQeQ/edit?usp=sharing) that will be used as a manifesto.  - We develop a mobile plateform which aims to boost their visibility with the help of their customers, turning them into ambassadors.  #### We want it to be a co-creation, because we believe that real change in the 21st century can only be done in a bottom-up fashion.  # Contribute  We are looking for people to help us by: - opening their doors for (one or more) events, contact us via the mail adress below our join [our slack](https://womercollective.slack.com/messages/general/) to discuss directly with us - joining (permanently or not) our **core team** to boost our communication - participate in our **collective** to grow our member base of responsible shops and customers, join [our slack](https://womercollective.slack.com/messages/general/) to learn more ;-) - contributing financially to the development of our plateform.

Our mission is to spread ideas, encourage innovation, and offer a behind the scenes glance of the people behind well-known and impactful developer products.  We have always been passionate about developer tools and open-source, but felt that the community was missing the raw details and inside scoop on what it takes to build a valuable developer product from the ground-up. And so we started this passion project in October 2016.  Our goal with this interview series is to share experiences that are often hidden behind a product or GitHub repo so that everyone, including aspiring makers, can learn from them.   We began with three posts: * [What is Between the Wires?](https://betweenthewires.org/what-is-between-the-wires-a68a2eb506f5#.bhuv7rpxt) * [Interview with Guillermo Rauch](https://betweenthewires.org/between-the-wires-guillermo-rauch-2819177beedc#.4s9sbpdtl) * [Interview with Evan You](https://betweenthewires.org/between-the-wires-evan-you-cb56660bc8a4#.y4x0r6juo)  The initial feedback has been great and we feel encouraged about the seriesÛª future. Developing these highly-polished interviews is a labor of love though, and requires a good deal of time as well as cost. For example, for each interview, we spend about 12 hours studying the candidates, completing the interview, taking the picture, editing and polishing the transcript, and finally publishing and promoting. Our labor is going to be free because it is a passion project, but we do need to look for community contribution to cover expenses such as transcribing, copy editing, camera equipment rental, and a few miscellaneous fees.

386,Preact,3kb alternative to React with the same ES6 API.,USD,TRUE,"Preact is a tiny **3kb** implementation of the core value proposition of React - _Virtual DOM Components_.  It is narrowly focussed on striking an ideal balance between **minimalism** and **utility**.   # Closer to the Metal  Preact provides the thinnest possible Virtual DOM abstraction on top of the DOM. The web is a stable platform, it's time we stopped reimplementing it in the name of safety.  Preact is also a first-class citizen of the web platform. It diffs Virtual DOM against the DOM itself, registers real event handlers, and plays nicely with other libraries.   # Small & Fast  ### _Ù_ Good things come in small packages  Most UI frameworks are large enough to be the majority of an app's JavaScript size. Preact is different: it's small enough that your code is the largest part of your application.  That means less JavaScript to download, parse and execute - leaving more time for your code, so you can build an experience you define without fighting to keep a framework under control.  ### _Ù_Ñ Need for speed  Preact is fast, and not just because of its size. It's one of the fastest Virtual DOM libraries out there, thanks to a simple and predictable diff implementation.  It even includes extra performance features like customizable update batching, optional async rendering, recycling and optimized event handling via Linked State.  ### _Ù_Õ Portable and embeddable  Preact's tiny footprint and isolated nature lets you take the Virtual DOM Component paradigm places it couldn't otherwise go.  Use Preact to build parts of an app without complex integration. Embed Preact into a widget and apply the same tools and techniques that you would to build a full app.   # Instantly Productive  Lightweight is a lot more fun when you don't have to sacrifice productivity to get there. Preact gets you productive right away.  ###  _ÙªÎ  Harness the React ecosystem  Virtual DOM Components make it easy to share reusable things - everything from buttons to data providers. Preact's design means you can seamlessly use thousands of Components available in the React ecosystem.  Adding a simple [preact-compat](https://preactjs.com/guide/switching-to-preact#how-to-alias-preact-compat) alias to your bundler provides a compatibility layer that enables even the most complex React components to be used in your application.  ### _Áü Built-in bonus features  - props, state and context are passed to render() - [Linked State](https://preactjs.com/guide/linked-state) replaces repetitive event handler code - Use standard HTML attributes like `class` and `for`",https://opencollective-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/3fd44c50-b42b-11e6-8e7e-5955bbcb143d.png,preact,https://preactjs.com,preactjs,We are on a mission to dramatically reduce app size.,https://opencollective-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/8b0d1710-b425-11e7-9898-89bb7dc2e927.jpg,"{""open source""}",FALSE,COLLECTIVE,"{""githubContributors"":{""developit"":760,""robertknight"":46,""greenkeeperio-bot"":27,""NekR"":16,""aimwhy"":10,""mkxml"":9,""braddunbar"":8,""gpoitch"":6,""valotas"":6,""harish2704"":4,""jmrog"":4,""Download"":4,""vutran"":4,""sangupta"":3,""ouzhenkun"":3,""amilajack"":2,""bmeurer"":2,""vaneenige"":2,""impronunciable"":2,""btd"":2,""jdanford"":2,""jmfirth"":2,""lukeed"":2,""matthewp"":2,""kruczy"":2,""siddharthkp"":2,""trashhalo"":2,""billneff79"":2,""juicelink"":2,""mseddon"":2,""rmacklin"":2,""asolove"":2,""ivantm"":2,""ansballard"":1,""awaw00"":1,""andrejsm"":1,""bouk"":1,""sheepsteak"":1,""k1r0s"":1,""Craga89"":1,""crisward"":1,""dmail"":1,""plusCubed"":1,""darrenscerri"":1,""tsaiDavid"":1,""crispgm"":1,""ProLoser"":1,""kwoon"":1,""ericperez"":1,""ezekielchentnik"":1,""queckezz"":1,""FezVrasta"":1,""feross"":1,""hassanbazzi"":1,""HenningM"":1,""UnwrittenFun"":1,""aeosynth"":1,""jxodwyer"":1,""jrf0110"":1,""jpsc"":1,""katyo"":1,""KrofDrakula"":1,""le0nik"":1,""leonid-bauxy"":1,""luisvinicius167"":1,""c2h5oh"":1,""markselby9"":1,""KnisterPeter"":1,""marvinhagemeister"":1,""i-like-robots"":1,""mhink"":1,""MicheleBertoli"":1,""Pomax"":1,""povrazor"":1,""mike-north"":1,""gnarf"":1,""nathancahill"":1,""nhunzaker"":1,""wyze"":1,""ngasull"":1,""nojvek"":1,""dharFr"":1,""PeterDaveHello"":1,""pl12133"":1,""piamancini"":1,""ReadmeCritic"":1,""robbiewxyz"":1,""slaskis"":1,""rubenmoya"":1,""RyanCavanaugh"":1,""sgrowe"":1,""seveves"":1,""shidhincr"":1,""niedzielski"":1,""tlakomy"":1,""tbekolay"":1,""tusharmath"":1,""xdamman"":1,""yanni4night"":1,""boiawang"":1,""cotttpan"":1,""afeiship"":1,""hrldcpr"":1,""jmarsh999"":1,""slmgc"":1,""sskoopa"":1,""steelbrain"":1,""tatchi"":1,""windyGex"":1}}",2016-11-26 20:54:51.409+00,2017-11-23 19:32:09.121+00,

413,Octobox,Take back control of your GitHub notifications,USD,TRUE,"If you manage more than one active project on GitHub, you probably find GitHub Notifications pretty lacking.  Notifications are marked as read and disappear from the list as soon as you load the page or view the email of the notification. This makes it very hard to keep on top of which notifications you still need to follow up on. Most open source maintainers and GitHub staff end up using a complex combination of filters and labels in Gmail to manage their notifications from their inbox. If, like me, you try to avoid email, then you might want something else.  Octobox adds an extra &quot;archived&quot; state to each notification so you can mark it as &quot;done&quot;. If new activity happens on the thread/issue/pr, the next time you sync the app the relevant item will be unarchived and moved back into your inbox.

Just extract the ZIP archive, and you are already up and running.  It follows similar principles to other flat-file CMS platforms, but has a different design philosophy than most. Grav comes with a powerful **Package Management System** to allow for simple installation and upgrading of plugins and themes, as well as simple updating of Grav itself.  The underlying architecture of Grav is designed to use well-established and _best-in-class_ technologies to ensure that Grav is simple to use and easy to extend.

We're focused on assisting people with code, or playing games in our spare time. Cheese.lab Industries is set out to help and fuse people's skills together and by working together and teaching each other We're set on creating a crowdlearning platform that is easily accessible on Discord & existing opensource technologies. As we observe the growth and as more users join us, it opens up more opportunities for people to learn from each other and have fun at the same time!  # __CURRENT & FUTURE OBJECTIVES__  We're focusing on bringing fun experiences to the gaming & programming community. By creating fun environments such as learning how to code, or just hanging out playing games on various social media platforms. We believe that with other people involved, it will allow us to further outreach our community and in turn do more exciting things with the community such as competitions and giveaways.  Not only that but in the future we plan to expand to other communities. Eventually, we want to become completely decentralized so the community can run by itself.  # __CURRENT COMMUNITIES__  These are the communities you can expect to find on **Cheese.lab Industries**. As we're on a decentralized Discord server, you can choose what community you want to opt-in to. We believe that a decentralized space with different communities with different usages makes it better than switching to a completely different server and losing your user base. Thus, in the future, once there are more features on Discord, we'll be arranging each community into channel groups.   **Cheese.lab Academy**   Cheese.lab Academy is a coding community run by gamers & coders for gamers & coders. By crowdlearning and sharing our skills, we learn from each other. Person **A** could be learning JavaScript while being an expert in C#. Person **B** could lack skills in C# and learn that language from Person **A**, and help Person **A** with JavaScript. It's a concept we love and it's really effective when you have several people in a chat helping each other out.  **Cheese.lab**  Cheese.lab is our gaming community. When we've stopped teaching people how to code, we move over to the lab and have gaming events or just chill out and chat. There are roleplay-esque elements, such as lab-themed entities. We hope to run D&D-like events in the future to broaden our horizons.   *More communities coming soon as we approach new projects.*  # WEBSITE  You can find out more about us on our website: [cheeselab.industries](https://cheeselab.industries)  # ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT  We're always actively developing Cheese.lab Industries and experimenting with new ideas. And we're always looking for new developers to join in and contribute to the code. Come visit the [Discord](https://discord.gg/lab) if you're interested and we'll see what we can do.   # SOCIAL  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cheeselab)   [GitHub](https://github.com/Cheeselab)  [Discord](https://discord.gg/lab)  # BACKING THE PROJECT  Other people can contribute by becoming a volunteer and creating brand awareness & general word-of-mouth to help make the project flourish and get other gamers & programmers on board. We believe in fairness and fun! You'll also get a swanky new Donator role too!  Your support will help us cover server costs (websites, bot servers, projects, etc) to run this place and keep it completely free of charge for the public. We don't require you to donate a penny, but you can if you feel it will help us keep our various servers running. All we ask is for your continued support and help us by volunteering your time.

546,PumpkinDB,,USD,TRUE,"PumpkinDB is an immutable ordered key-value database engine, featuring:  * ACID transactions * Persistent storage * An embedded programming language (PumpkinScript) * Binary keys and values (allows any encoding to be used: JSON, XML, Protobuf, Cap'n Proto, etc.) * Standalone and embedded scenarios   ## Why immutable?  Simply put, the data replaced is data deleted and is therefore, an unsafe way to manage data. Bugs, misunderstanding, changing scope and requirements and other factors might influence what data (and especially *past* data) means and how can it be used.  By guaranteeing the immutability of key's value once it is set, PumpkinDB forces its users to think of their data through a temporal perspective.  This approach is highly beneficial for implementing event sourcing and similar types of architectures.  ## What is PumpkinDB?  PumpkinDB is essentially a database programming environment, largely inspired by core ideas behind [MUMPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUMPS). Instead of M, it has a Forth-inspired stack-based language, PumpkinScript. Instead of hierarchical keys, it has a flat key namespace and doesn't allow overriding values once they are set.  Core motivation for immutability was that with the cost of storage declining, erasing data is effectively a strategical mistake.  While not intended for general purpose programming, its main objective is to facilitate building specialized application-specific and generic databases with a particular focus on immutability and processing data as close to storage as possible, incurring as little communication penalty as possible.  Applications communicate with PumpkinDB by sending small PumpkinScript programs over a network interface (or API when using PumpkinDB as an embedded solution).  PumpkinDB offers a wide array of primitives for concurrency, storage, journalling, indexing and other common building blocks.  ## Why is it a database engine?  The core ideas behind PumpkinDB stem from the so called [lazy event sourcing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqv8d1pjmU8) approach which is based on storing and indexing events while delaying domain binding for as long as possible. That said, the intention of this database is to be a building block for different kinds of architectures, be it classic event sourcing (using it as an event store), lazy event sourcing (using indices) or anything else. It's also possible to implement different approaches within a single database for different parts of the domain.  Instead of devising custom protocols for talking to PumpkinDB, the protocol of communication has become a pipeline to a script executor. This offers us enormous extension and flexibility capabilities.  While an external application can talk to PumpkinDB over a network connection, PumpkinDB's engine itself is embeddable and can be used directly. Currenly, it is available for Rust applications only, but this may one day extend to all languages that can interface with C.",https://opencollective-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/18639830-058c-11e7-9830-7d50753fd1be.png,pumpkindb,http://pumpkindb.org/,,"We are on a mission of building a modern, immutable database engine",,"{""open source""}",FALSE,COLLECTIVE,"{""githubContributors"":{""yrashk"":387,""omarkj"":98,""stuarth"":71,""Matt8898"":9,""eav"":3,""theduke"":3,""mardiros"":2,""dhardy"":1,""piamancini"":1,""rushmorem"":1}}",2017-03-10 12:27:14.747+00,2017-11-23 19:30:51.052+00,

561,ReactiveUI,,USD,TRUE,"When building applications, if you take a step back and look at the forest instead of the trees, you will see that most of your code is reacting to something that changed or trying to control application state.  ReactiveUI provides you with building blocks that are particularly adept at expressing the relationship between a group of changing things and allows you to express the intent of a product feature in a single readable place which makes managing application state a piece of cake.  Applications built with ReactiveUI cope gracefully as the application gets more complicated because of the foundations of reactive programming that ReactiveUI is built upon.    You'll find ReactiveUI inside of products made by Amazon (Cloud Drive), Atlassian (Sourcetree), Slack (Mobile), GitHub (Visual Studio), Elastic (Search) and 343 Industries (Halo 5)  # _Ù_ä There is a Better Way _Ù_ä  Instead of imperative programming, we can use a paradigm called Functional Reactive Programming which allows you to model user input as a function that changes over time, abstracting away the idea of mutable state. Reactive programming can look scary and complex at first glance, but the best way to describe reactive programming is to think of a spreadsheet:  * Imagine three cells, A, B, and C. * C is defined as the sum of A and B. * Whenever A or B changes, C reacts to update itself.  _That's reactive programming: changes propagate throughout a system automatically._  [![](https://i.imgur.com/n9qFRE4.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4inY7TFEVT0)  # _Ù_ What We'll Use the Money For _Ù_  Our initial goal is $x,000/month. That money will be enough to [restore the imbalance of open-source](http://nadiaeghbal.com/oss/) ,  those who support you will now be supported. If ReactiveUI has no maintainers it will quickly become useless to all users and the project will die... _again_  * ***Hire a technical writer*** to improve the project documentation, focusing on making reactive programming more accessible. * ***StackOverflow questions answered within 72 hours*** with best practices and authoritative solutions. *  ***One maintainer - part-time.***  Open-source succeeds in every aspect except sustaining those who sustain open-source. Transitioning to semi-employed allows more time to be spent improving ReactiveUI and more time with family.  As open-source software scales, projects need someone to handle things like community interaction, backlog triage, defect investigation and doing servant leadership activities to increase the productivity of maintainers, contributors and consumers.  Currently, these tasks take a few hours every day which means there are minimal blocks of focused time available to work on framework features, do ambitious things or support the community at a higher level and is a source of friction for any maintainer that has family commitments. * ***Tooling*** that automates maintainer activities, essentially exchanging money to buy time.  We currently use services to automate marketing, interactions between services and provide community analytics. This fee grows as the community grows.  # _Áü Stretch Goal _Áü  The stretch goal ($xx,000/month) is a total game changer and enough to keep ReactiveUI going, indefinitely and take reactive programming to the next level, enabling us to do things like:   * ***Two maintainers - part-time*** or ***One maintainer - full time*** to work on new framework features, do A+ level community management, mentor newbies, ship solutions to defects in < 72 hours and maintain upstream dependencies such as System.Reactive. * ***Internship - paid*** for a student (ala google summer of code) to hack on research and shipping advancements to tooling/the reactive programming ecosystem. * ***Create tooling that visualizes observables*** to provide developers with a live birds-eye view of their application, all observables within it and the signals they and where they were created from. * ***Make reactive programming more accessible*** by taking documentation/learning experience to 11. Imagine, ReactiveUI running in your browser via webassembly so that developers have a REPL like an experience to learn the concepts of reactive programming in .NET without having to download or install anything.  The stretch goal would be amazing to hit, but simply being totally supported by the generosity of others makes us endlessly grateful, no matter what else happens.   Anyway, thanks for any support you can offer if you decide to - _Geoffrey Huntley_  #  _ÙÔ¬Û_ÙÕÈ Team _ÙÔ¬Û_ÙÕÈ  ![](https://i.imgur.com/sBwIMcp.jpg)  ReactiveUI is made possible by these wonderful people.

We are a .NET Foundation project that is developed under an OSI-approved open source license, making it freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use.  Other projects that are associated with the foundation include the .NET Compiler Platform (""Roslyn"") as well as the ASP.NET family of projects, .NET Core & Xamarin Forms.

You'll be investing into the personal growth and development of your employees whilst at the same time improving their knowledge of the abstractions they build upon which leads to skill improvements and improved quality of deliverables to your clients. * Run in-person (or remote) workshops that teach software developers how to think reactively and express themselves in a reactive manner. * Help with the hiring, sourcing and interviewing of quality software developers who grok reactive programming.  Specifics available upon enquiry. * Get hands-on help from ReactiveUI's experienced team members and solution architects for developer support services, code-reviews, design and architecture reviews.  Ask development questions via email or a private support desk and get prompt answers from an expert. * Hire the maintainers of ReactiveUI to aide with the development of your application that uses the framework (terms: sections of work, unrelated to your core intellectual property that are related to the framework may be released as open-source but only after mutal discussions)  # Ó Frequently Asked Questions Ó * If you help or support us, we will help you and provide services - this isn't a charity cause. Instead of a hiring an expensive booth at a conference to attract the attention of software developers why not stand out from the crowd by sponsoring an open-source project? It's a quick and easy way to hack the hearts of software developers and realign your companies brand away from the competition. You'll get continual and measurable leads throughout the year instead of a once-off big bang experiment which may not pay off. Interested? Start [a private discussion](mailto:hello@reactiveui.net) with Geoffrey Huntley and we will figure this out, together. * Support and maintenance efforts are directed towards the needs of our paying backers, sponsors and customers first.

580,Babel,Babel is a compiler for writing next generation JavaScript,USD,TRUE,"You'll be helping Babel's maintainers manage a project used by most of the world to compile their JavaScript.  A clear thing we need is the funding to allow us to attend [TC39 (the committee that specifies JavaScript) meetings](https://github.com/tc39/agendas/) which are every 2 months at various companies around the world. This allows us to be involved in the process that moves various JavaScript proposals forward, allowing us to understand and take part in that discussion and be an implementor similar to other browsers.  ---  Babel helps you write the latest version of JavaScript, and is helping shape the future of the language itself. It's used at Facebook, Google, Netflix, and [hundreds of other companies](http://babeljs.io/users/). It's downloaded more than [9 million times a month on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-core). (We're currently just a small group of volunteers that spends their free time maintaining this project)  When your target browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE) don't support certain features natively, it helps you compile it down to a supported version.  In short, developers want to take advantage of the latest syntax in JavaScript before it's implemented in browsers, now. Because the version of JavaScript depends on the client's browser, we can't rely on the fact they are using an up to date browser.  Babel abstracts the browser away so that you can worry about writing your application rather than trying to figure out what features are supported in each one.  For example: if you support an older browser such as Internet Explorer 9, it won't have any of the features in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), so Babel will transform your code into ES5 which is supported.

MvvmCross supports a very wide variety of platforms. It allows you to share business logic and behavior between these platforms.  MvvmCross is an opinionated Framework, which tries to cover most common use cases and provides a very wide variety of features to support these. Among these features there is:  - Service Locator - Dependency Injection (constructor and property) - ViewModel to ViewModel navigation - Support for a lot of platform specific presentation modes (tabs, hamburger menu and more) - Lots of official and 3rd party plugins for sensors, contacts, settings and more  ## What Will The Money Be Used For?  The initial goal would be $x,000 per month. That money would be used towards hiring a maintainer part time. MvvmCross is seeing quite a lot of uptake. More and more developers use MvvmCross. This in turn means more issues to triage, more questions asked on StackOverflow, Slack and other means.  Having someone part time, would help speeding some of these things up and hopefully relieve the core maintainers and let them focus on fixing issues and improving the framework.  We would also love to improve our documentation by hiring someone writing new documentation and improving on current.  ## Dream Scenario  This will change everything! If we could get $xx,000 per month, it would be enough to get MvvmCross very far. It would enable us to hire a maintainer full time or perhaps two maintainers part time.  We would be able to deliver better out of the box experience, more extensive documentation, ship fixes to issues faster.

811,Open Collective,We are on a mission to create a new generation of association transparent by design,USD,TRUE,"We are building an open source software to enable associations to operate in full transparency.  Our code is released under MIT License on Github: https://github.com/opencollective.  You can come chat with us on Slack: https://slack.opencollective.org   # Why?  Today, associations are like binary apps on top of Microsoft Windows. They are hard to create and even harder to scale across multiple operating systems (countries). Furthermore, because they are ""close source"", they can't learn much from each other. They operate in silos and they each have to reinvent the wheel (how to do accounting, reporting, etc.).  We learned with the Internet that if we build software in the browser where everybody can ""View Source"", we don't have anymore to waste time solving problems that have already been solved. We can ""copy paste"" and learn from each other. This creates a new environment within which we don't compete anymore but we share and collaborate.  We want to apply that to the world of organizations.  # How?  Our goal is to build a network of fiscal sponsors, existing legal entities that can host open collectives under their umbrella. Think of this like hosting someone else's website on your own web server so that your friend doesn't have to worry about the technicality of it.  Because Open Collectives are operating in full transparency, the risk is limited. But the benefit is massive because it will enable our communities to start collecting money, having a budget and be financially self sustainable without having to worry about the technicality of setting up and maintaining a legal entity.  Those host organizations are effectively abstracting the underlying operating system of their country to enable people in their community to focus on their mission.  # How can you help?  There are many ways you can help:  - Spread the word (see also the blog posts we post on https://medium.com/open-collective -- we also welcome guest posts on the topic of future of organizations) - If you are a member of an existing association, create an open collective of it and host other collectives that share your values (see for example [Women Who Code](https://opencollective.com/wwcode) who is now hosting 72 open collectives for their local chapters, or [Operation Code](https://opencollective.com/operationcode)) - Contribute to the code: https://github.com/opencollective - Create a local meetup - Contribute financially to this collective.

829,Bruss-it,,EUR,TRUE,"Wil jij Brussel beter, mooier en slimmer maken? Samen met je vereniging, organisatie, wijk of burgercollectief?  De Vlaamse Gemeeschap Commissie geeft vernieuwende initiatieven van stadsmakers een duwtje in de rug en lanceerde in 2016 en 2017 de projectoproep Bruss-it.  # What is Bruss-it?  In het kader van zijn stedelijk beleid maakt het College van de VGC werk van sociale stadsinnovatie. Via de projectoproep Û÷Bruss-itÛª ondersteunt de VGC enthousiaste stadsmakers. 'Bruss-it' richt zich tot verenigingen, organisaties, groepen van burgers en burgercollectieven. Met Bruss-it steunt de VGC, in het kader van het Stedenfonds, projecten met als thema gemeenschapsvorming in de gedeelde ruimte.  Dat kan bijvoorbeeld gaan over:  Ontmoetingen en uitwisselingen Ruimtes delen en tijdelijk invullen Sociale en culturele interventies op publieke of semi-publieke plekken Het zijn projecten die de verbeelding stimuleren en die aanzetten tot ontmoeting en uitwisseling. Stedelijk, innovatie, participatie en diversiteit zijn de sleutelwoorden. Klik hier voor de volledige projectoproep 2017.  De oproep 2017 is afgesloten. Houd de website en de Facebook-pagina van Stedelijk beleid in de gaten voor een nieuwe oproep.  Wil je meer weten over de projecten? Bekijk hier de projecten die in 2016 en 2017 een subsidie kregen.  De jury beoordeelt de projectaanvragen op basis van deze criteria: Aanpak op het gebied van slim ruimtegebruik Betrokkenheid van bewoners en partners in de wijk Innovatieve en creatieve aanpak Mate van zelfinitiatief en mede-eigenaarschap van de doelgroep(en) Oog voor diversiteit op het vlak van deelnemers, werkwijze en partners Realistische en concrete uitwerking, timing en budget Je krijgt maximaal 15.000 euro voor je project. Ook kleinschalige initiatieven voor een lager bedrag komen in aanmerking.  # Veelgestelde vragen  Hier vind je een antwoord op enkele veelgestelde vragen. Vind je geen antwoord op je vraag, dan kan je contact opnemen met de cel Stedelijk Beleid. Hoeveel tijd heb ik om mijn project uit te voeren? Je moet je project realiseren binnen de 18 maanden nadat de VGC de subsidie heeft toegekend. Lukt dat niet? Dan vraagt de VGC het bedrag terug, helemaal of voor een deel.  Komt er nog een projectoproep? Ja, in 2018 herhalen we de oproep. Je kan dan opnieuw een projectaanvraag indienen.   Wie kan een subsidie krijgen? Je kan een subsidie krijgen als:  vzw openbaar bestuur of instelling feitelijke vereniging (met inbegrip van burgercollectieven) Je moet een duidelijke band hebben met het Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest.  Welk subsidiebedrag kan ik aanvragen? Je krijgt maximaal 15.000 euro per project. Ook kleinschalige initiatieven voor een lager subsidiebedrag komen in aanmerking.  Voor welke projecten krijg ik geen subsidie? Je krijgt geen subsidie voor projecten met louter commerciÌÇle doeleinden.  Je krijgt ook geen subsidie voor projecten die alleen een link hebben met gewestbevoegdheden en geen link hebben met gemeenschapsbevoegdheden (cultuur, jeugd, sport, onderwijs, vorming, welzijn, gezondheid en gezin).  Je krijgt geen subsidie voor projecten die reeds gesubsidieerd werden bij een vorige editie van deze oproep.  Voor welke kosten mag ik de subsidie gebruiken? Je mag de subsidie niet gebruiken voor de reguliere werking van je organisatie.  Je kunt de projectsubsidie alleen gebruiken voor het project waarvoor de subsidie werd toegekend. Alleen kosten die nodig zijn om het project tot een goed einde te brengen, worden aanvaard.  De projectoproep sluit aan bij het Stedenfonds. Houd ook rekening met de richtlijnen voor Stedenfondsmiddelen: je vindt ze hier.  Hoe worden de projecten beoordeeld?

868,Open Collective Europe,,EUR,TRUE,"Our goal is to develop a new generation of non profit organization across Europe. There are so many great citizen initiatives happening everywhere but as soon as they need to raise funds, they need to waste precious time to worry about all the paperwork required to  create and maintain a 20th century association. We can do better.  Open Collective Europe enables communities to create a virtual non profit so that they can start collecting money without having to worry about setting up yet another legal entity and accounting. All those collectives are transparent by design. This creates an environment where the community feels more comfortable to chip in and financially support the activities of the collective. It also creates an environment where each collective can learn from each other. No more silos.  &gt; **[Apply to create your collective](https://opencollective.com/europe/apply)**  ## FAQ - **What can an open collective do?** An open collective can collect one time and recurring donations (monthly or yearly). Anyone in the community can file expenses for reimbursement. After approval by the administrators of the collective, the host (in this case Open Collective Europe Non Profit) reimburse the full amount. [Learn More](https://opencollective.com/learn-more). You can also create events and sell tickets and sponsorships, for example:  https://opencollective.com/brusselstogether/events/meetup-7 https://opencollective.com/veganizerbxl/events/superfilles  - ** How much does it cost?** There is a 10% administration fee + credit card fees (1.4% + âÂ0.25 for European cards and 2.9% + âÂ0.25 for non-European cards).   - ** What are the limitations?** You cannot hire people (except freelancers). Beyond that, your collective acts as your own virtual association.  - **Where can I find more information?*** See the FAQ on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/faq)  See other example of host organizations that are enabling people in their community to create open collectives: - [BrusselsTogether](https://opencollective.com/brusselstogether) enables citizens in Brussels to create open collectives - [Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource) enables open source projects to collect money to sustain themselves - [Women Who Code](https://opencollective.com/wwcode) enables more than 70 local chapters around the world to focus on their mission.",,europe-collective,,,We are the host organization for EU based open collectives,,{opencollectiveeu},TRUE,COLLECTIVE,"{""UserId"":6848}",2017-08-28 14:55:05.979+00,2017-09-15 16:11:38.675+00,

922,doit,,USD,TRUE,"the tool for **stateful processing of your interdependent tasks** powered by:  - nuclear power-plant within your **shell** - **python** batteries - **doit** processing engine  doit is mature project started in 2008 by @shettino72 and maintained by him up to date. It already serves years in numerous projects to:  - simplify cumbersome command line calls, - automate complex data processing or typical project related actions, - share unified way of doing things, - optimize processing time by skipping things already done.    People often compare `doit` to tools like `make`, `grunt` or `gulp` but they always appreciate  - strong features and flexibility - simplicity of authoring and ease of use - python    # Current focus There are two current priorities:    ## A: Maintain existing codebase The aim is to **keep the product in shape and usable**.  Abandoned open-source project does not work for long. Thriving project requires a maintainer to keep list of issues and list of pull requests short.  Financial goal is 500 USD per month to allow the maintainer working few hours a week on the project.  Main capacity shall be provided by @schettino72  ## B: Refactor documentation The aim is to **lower initial learning barrier for newcomers to get them on board** and to **help pro-users to unlock more features and earn fame**.  Existing documentation is good as it served well existing users. But we can serve better. Inspired by great talk [What nobody tells you about documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4vKPhjcMZg&t=4s) by Daniele Procida we plan to refactor the documentation into following parts:  - Introduction (basic features overview) - Quick start and tutorials - Reference documentation - Concepts - Howtos    Financial goal is another 500 USD per month to allow documentation writer working few hours a week on documentation refactoring and maintenance.  Main capacity shall be provided by @vlcinsky.  # Long term vision Assuming the A and B priorities are fulfilled, we shall look further on into future.  ## C: Promote We believe, many more users deserve `doit` and we shall help them to know about it.  Promotion may have form of:  - helping selected python projects to adopt doit as internal tool - video presentations - presentation(s) at pycon(s)    This is long term priority and there is no budget set for it at the moment.  ## D: Launch doit task libraries  Grunt library has over 6000 tasks, gulp has over 3000 plug-ins.  `doit` has similar potential. E.g. [doit-py](https://github.com/pydoit/doit-py) covers python code specific tasks. Few lines of code in [dodo.py](https://github.com/pydoit/doit-py/blob/master/dodo.py) to lint the code; run the tests and measure coverage; build and upload package; spell, build and publish sphinx based documentation.  This is long term priority and there is no budget set for it at the moment.  # Why to contribute?  Because:  - You can already use existing power of the tool. - The [github doit repository](https://github.com/pydoit/doit) shows stable, long term activity with small but existing community of secondary contributors. - You can see, we have clear plan and priorities. - You can improve your productivity with maintained tool and streamlined documentation. - You can doit.",https://opencollective-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/3ccf2280-a4f5-11e7-b03e-ef99d4397756,doit,https://github.com/pydoit/doit,,tasks => {doit + shell + python} => done,,"{""open source"",python,build-automation,build-tool,task-runner}",FALSE,COLLECTIVE,"{""githubContributors"":{""schettino72"":1029,""invalid-email-address"":15,""Kwpolska"":11,""felixfontein"":7,""Hinidu"":5,""TMiguelT"":3,""onnodb"":3,""schwager-hsph"":3,""saimn"":3,""takluyver"":3,""vincent-ferotin"":3,""rolegic"":3,""magmax"":2,""moltob"":2,""rbeagrie"":2,""smutch"":2,""ankostis"":2,""asood123"":1,""lamby"":1,""poliquin"":1,""FlorianLudwig"":1,""FrankStain"":1,""vlcinsky"":1,""lelit"":1,""frenzymadness"":1,""nsegata"":1,""gstorer"":1,""swayf"":1,""tonyfast"":1}}",2017-09-15 06:53:57.336+00,2017-11-23 19:31:43.257+00,

TypeORM is highly influenced by other ORMs, such as [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/orm/),  [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) and [Entity Framework](https://www.asp.net/entity-framework).  Some of TypeORM features:  * supports both DataMapper and ActiveRecord (your choice) * entities and columns * database-specific column types * entity manager * repositories and custom repositories * clean object relational model * associations (relations) * eager and lazy relations * uni-directional, bi-directional and self-referenced relations * supports multiple inheritance patterns * cascades * indices * transactions * migrations and automatic migrations generation * connection pooling * replication * using multiple database connections * working with multiple databases types * cross-database and cross-schema queries * elegant-syntax, flexible and powerful QueryBuilder * left and inner joins * proper pagination for queries using joins * query caching * streaming raw results * logging * listeners and subscribers (hooks) * supports closure table pattern * schema declaration in models or separate configuration files * connection configuration in json / xml / yml / env formats * supports MySQL / MariaDB / Postgres / SQLite / Microsoft SQL Server / Oracle / WebSQL * supports MongoDB NoSQL database * works in NodeJS / Browser / Ionic / Cordova / Electron platforms * TypeScript and JavaScript support * produced code is performant, flexible, clean and maintainable * follows all possible best practices * CLI  And more...",https://opencollective-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/a90da2c0-a82c-11e7-8125-a1bea2bef08c.png,typeorm,typeorm.io,,Our mission is to bring best ORM for app of any scale - from small apps to huge enterprise solutions,,"{active-record,data-mapping,database,javascript,mariadb,mysql,oracle,orm,postgresql,sqlite,sqlserver,typeorm,typescript,websql,""open source""}",FALSE,COLLECTIVE,"{""githubContributors"":{""pleerock"":1332,""AlexMesser"":102,""iz-iznogood"":65,""daniel-lang"":62,""luchillo17"":18,""mingyang91"":16,""19majkel94"":13,""hajekj14"":11,""Salimlou"":11,""tjme"":10,""eyalhakim"":9,""johannespfeiffer"":8,""aj-liptak"":6,""iRath96"":6,""EreckGordon"":6,""aequasi"":5,""yannisgu"":5,""cserron"":5,""asood123"":4,""Diluka"":4,""stahlstift"":4,""apezel"":3,""CWSpear"":3,""CreepGin"":3,""BrainMaestro"":3,""MaikelH"":3,""elthrasher"":3,""mdziekon"":3,""Ostrzy"":3,""rodrigopandini"":3,""shicholas"":3,""NoNameProvided"":2,""eduardoweiland"":2,""erickponce"":2,""felipesabino"":2,""strictd"":2,""joffray589"":2,""mrkmg"":2,""Kononnable"":2,""lukaszklis"":2,""Luke265"":2,""navossoc"":2,""slavafomin"":2,""gitter-badger"":2,""Tobias4872"":2,""ruiming"":2,""aldahick"":1,""asvetliakov"":1,""All-Our-Life-Yakdu"":1,""AmirTugi"":1,""as-com"":1,""babbarankit"":1,""bakhodur-kandikov"":1,""solon"":1,""Christian24"":1,""gdeividas"":1,""seeekr"":1,""dustin-H"":1,""jandsu"":1,""zetamorph"":1,""jmai00"":1,""netes"":1,""seungha-kim"":1,""puttputt"":1,""hisamu"":1,""marcinwadon"":1,""martinschleiss"":1,""maxiee"":1,""mustafa-hanif"":1,""pldin601"":1,""SamuelMarks"":1,""seanski"":1,""llwt"":1,""trodi"":1,""YuhangGe"":1,""benny-medflyt"":1,""cfowlerdev"":1,""dvlsg"":1,""f-wrobel"":1,""guscastro"":1,""johncoffee"":1}}",2017-09-23 07:24:38.248+00,2017-11-23 19:32:27.429+00,

The first objective is to bring back the Social Market that was established by the Moravian's (later to be sold off for profit motivations of the new proprietors).  The original Social Market was establish in 1752 in The Christmas City - Bethlehem, PA.    The 18th century Social Market was located on Market Street off of Main for which the street was named.   The original Social Market was a great success that funded the expansion of missionaries all over the world.   Stakeholders can now live and co-operate in the <i><b>SOCIAL</b>MARKET</i>ãÊ economic system.   Once again we can have a fair, moral and not-for-profit economy based on value and benefits.

We are doing this research and storytelling in collaboration with our counterparts in CubaÛªs free technology user group, GUTL (Grupo de Usuarios de TecnologÌ_as Libres).  In November 2017, our group is organizing an unconference track at [CubaConf.org](https://cubaconf.org), a free technology gathering where we will share common struggles, learn from one another, and build alternatives.

Or, if you wish to hear some background story or technical details, head to our [GitHub page](http://github.com/TigerHix/Cytoid).  # Our mission  Cytoid is a mobile rhythm game born in the community ÛÓ all levels are designed & created by players like you. Our primary goal is straightforward: if you are a music lover, you can enjoy your favorite songs by the means of a rhythm game; if you are a rhythm game lover, there are hundreds (if not thousands in the future) of levels waiting for you to take a challenge on. Best if you are both.  But we also want to achieve something else. Do you routinely discover new music, or stick to your usual taste? In fact, many small musicians make amazing tracks, but so many of them are under-discovered. We **strongly encourage** level creators (or even musicians themselves) to design levels for undiscovered indie music, exposing them to Cytoid's expanding player base. After all, awesome music ought to be heard, right?  # Contribute  There are many ways to contribute: if you are an Unity developer, please join Cytoid's development on GitHub; if you are a chart maker, please create some fun charts for everyone to play. But since this page mostly involves money, let's talk about financial stuff.  Simply put, increasing popularity  Õ increasing server expenses  Õ developers go broke  Õ end of Cytoid.  Or not ÛÓ if some server expenses could be covered by those who find Cytoid so enjoyable that they have an urge to throw their money at the developers' faces. By the way, we don't mind you doing it.  I would be honest, though; as of now, Cytoid's server costs are not really that expensive. The developers aren't anywhere near broken, either. But as the community grows bigger and more of the features become available (e.g. leaderboards, multiplayer), a cheap VPS would not suffice to withstand the traffic.  Of course, if you are just a kind-hearted person who want to treat the developers some coffee, we would not deny your benevolence. <3",https://opencollective-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/3c366f80-ac49-11e7-a9df-1bcb9eb984ce.png,cytoid,https://cytoid.io,cytoidio,Let's build a rhythm game for the community.,https://opencollective-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/32c9b740-ac49-11e7-a9df-1bcb9eb984ce.jpg,{default},FALSE,COLLECTIVE,{},2017-10-08 16:10:30.596+00,2017-10-08 18:14:08.266+00,

Kea is a state management library for React.

[epics](https://github.com/keajs/kea/issues/40) with redux-observable. * **Wrappable**: Write logic alongside React components. Easier than `setState` and perfect for small components. * **Connectable**: Pull in data and actions through ES6+ [imports](https://kea.js.org/guide/connected). Built for large and ambitious apps. * **No boilerplate**: Forget `mapStateToProps` and redundant constants. Only write code that matters! * **No new concepts**: Use actions, reducers and selectors. Gradually migrate [existing Redux applications](https://kea.js.org/guide/migration).  Compare it to other state management libraries: [Kea vs setState, Redux, Mobx, Dva, JumpState, Apollo, etc.](https://medium.com/@mariusandra/kea-vs-setstate-redux-mobx-dva-jumpstate-apollo-etc-4aa26ea11d02)  # Why should you help us?

9059,Agreelist,Tracking influencers' opinions,GBP,TRUE,"Agreelist is a **non-profit** aiming to fight misinformation and improve the quality of debates by showing **what people think and why, on both sides of key issues**.  There isnÛªt a single source that systematically provides views on both sides of important yet controversial topics, where people can proactively inform themselves and understand where people who disagree with them come from.  # Why we need Agreelist *""The **biggest problem in the world** is not global warming, is not war, but how can we organise among ourselves to **make good decisions** and carry them out.""* - Alex Pentland, MIT Professor  *""Like everyone, you are totally wrong about some of the things that you strongly believe.""* - Spencer Greenberg, mathematician and entrepreneur  Unfortunately, many times *""we are still more easily persuaded by one clear and concrete anecdote than by data and expert statistical analysis""* - Conor Neill, IESE Professor  # Accomplishments to date - More than 1000 opinions added - Features: Anyone can inform themselves by browsing opinions and opinion leaders, which can be viewed per profession and alma mater only. Users can add new topics, add if they agree or disagree and why and add opinions from influencers. It is also possible to follow topics and people as well as share opinions on Facebook and Twitter. The Agreelist platform includes an API and is integrated with Wikidata (Wikipedia's structured database) to get influencers' occupations and alma mater - Social channel tested with some influencers. E.g. we sent Andrew Ng (Stanford professor, Coursera founder, ex Google Brain, Baidu...) a tweet saying that we had added him to the list of who does and who does not support universal basic income, he read it and tweeted about us. This lead to meaningful traffic  - Several users found us via Reddit and Twitter, and added content on topics they cared about - 1 user found us through Twitter at a very early stage of development, and donated so that we would find 50 opinions from influencers on a topic of his choice. He was very satisfied with the quality of the opinions we found, and shared them with his network  # Use of proceeds - Improve UX / design of the home page and of the interface used to add influencers' opinions - Cover costs related to hosting, domain, ssl certificate for https, etc. - Add new topics with at least 25-50 opinions each. We need more content to make the platform more relavant and create more traffic (by sharing the content on other social media platforms), and ultimately switch to a model where users themselves generate content like on Wikipedia - Cover development costs of new features including automatic notifications on the topics and influencers users follow, improved integration with social media to facilitate sharing and viewing of content, improved integration with Wikidata to enable more data anlytics (eg. opinions per influencers' nationality, opinions from Nobel laureates in a given field only), the possibility for users to sign in with other social media accounts (Facebook, Google, Linkedin...), the ability to categorize multiple opinions per person on a topic.  - Add marketing, community, finance and operations capabilities  # Contribute You can be part of Agreelist by adding new opinions from influencers, by helping us to improve our open source software, and/or by donating. Contact us if there are other ways you can help eg. with UX/design!  In order to donate, you can either click on ""contribute"" on any of the boxes or on the ""donate"" link if you prefer to choose any one-time or monthly amount. Regular support is what will really help us getting Agreelist to its next stage of development. You can cancel your monthly contribution at any time.

Every time money or assets are donated or revenue is reinvested  the value of BUCKSãÊ increases. Co-operators or Community investors can cash in BUCKSãÊ on the http://openledgerdex.com; Customers and Support members can spend their BUCKSãÊ anywhere in the SOCIALMARKETãÊ at any time. The concept is revolutionary.  We are combining current, future frameworks and software to build the SOCIALMARKETãÊ. We will be utilizing open source, collective/co-op, gamification, decentralized apps and instructional-Alternate Reality Game theory alongside crypotocurrency token(s) within a multi-stakeholder community. Our goal is to start, build, expand and bring back to life new and defunct brands,  businesses under an open cooperative platform.  The whole community will be Gamified to inject healthy competition to further co-operative goals and increase the value of BUCKSãÊ . We might be gamified though remember, this is not a game!  Removing profit while building value and benefit is our core objective. We can achieve this with Solidarity in not-for-profit value motivations that benefit SOCIALMARKETãÊ.

If you would like to invest in the growth of the commons you could establish an openledgerdex.com account as described above and email us your account name so we can whitelist you into our OPEN COOP.    You then will be able to purchase BUCKSãÊ on the decentralized exchange.  Once you have $600 worth of BUCKSãÊ in your account we will give you access to our democratic tools to help build the commons.  You can collect up to $599.99 worth of BUCKSãÊ before you are no longer considered a customer earning discounts on products.

As a result,   engineers will often have to spend time tweaking the raw SVG path strings given to them by   designers before they can be morphed, which can take a significant amount of time. * Design tools often map to shape primitives not supported in certain platforms   (e.g. circles need to be represented by a sequence of curves and/or arcs,   not simply by their center point and radius). * Design tools cannot place multiple path points in the same location, a technique that   is often necessary when making two shapes compatible with each other. * Design tools provide no easy way to visualize the in-between states of the desired   path morph animation.  # Features  To address these problems, Shape Shifter provides the following features:  * *The ability to add/remove points to each path without altering their original appearance.* The added points can be modified by dragging them to different positions along the path, and they can be later deleted using the keyboard as well. * *The ability to reverse/shift the relative positions of each path's points.* While reordering points won't affect whether or not two paths are compatible, it often plays a huge role in determining the appearance of the resulting animation. * *Shape Shifter automatically converts incompatible pairs of SVG commands into a compatible   format.* There's no longer any need to convert `L`s into `Q`s and `A`s into `C`s by hand in   order to make your paths compatible&mdash;Shape Shifter does this for you behind-the-scenes! * *Shape Shifter provides a useful utility called 'auto fix', which takes two incompatible paths and attempts to make them compatible in an optimal way.* Depending on the complexity of the paths, auto fix may or may not generate a satisfying final result, so further modification may be necessary in order to achieve the animation you're looking for. * *The ability to export the results to SVG spritesheets, CSS keyframes, and Animated Vector Drawable format for use on the web and in Android applications.*    [adp-path-morphing]: http://www.androiddesignpatterns.com/2016/11/introduction-to-icon-animation-techniques.html#morphing-paths   [sketch]: https://www.sketchapp.com/   [illustrator]: http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html",https://opencollective-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/ab073300-b8fa-11e7-b1bb-61d84415be26.png,shapeshifter,http://github.com/alexjlockwood/ShapeShifter,,"Simplifies the creation of icon animations for Android, iOS, and the web!",https://opencollective-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/1268f890-b8ff-11e7-b1bb-61d84415be26.png,"{android,angular,animated-vector-drawables,icon-animations,ios,svg,typescript,""open source""}",FALSE,COLLECTIVE,"{""githubContributors"":{""alexjlockwood"":1949,""sambhav-gore"":1,""angular-cli"":1}}",2017-10-24 20:04:55.923+00,2017-11-23 19:31:30.343+00,

Oni is powered by Neovim, for a fully authentic Vim experience (no emulation!)  Oni is about going from _thought to code_ as quickly as possible, with less time configuring and more time being productive.  Why support Oni? ===  Oni is free and open-source - MIT Licensed - but developing features and functionality takes a lot of work. We believe in sustainable open source, and Oni is dependent on your financial support to continue.  We believe in transparent accounting, and giving back to the open source projects that power Oni.  Funds will be used as follows: - Cover our core expenses (AWS hosting, CI subscriptions, etc) - Compensation for contributors and maintainers time - Funding for projects that Oni depends on (Neovim, npm modules, etc)  If you find Oni useful in your day-to-day work, please consider contributing and making it possible to continue development!
